##  2.3.1 create Python scripts on the desktop 

We have installed Python's power builder, PyCharm, and VS Code in the last two lessons. In this lesson, we will take PyCharm as an example to write a very simple Python program, through which we can get a preliminary understanding of Python. Before writing the program, we will create a Python script file on the windows desktop. Please follow these steps: 

(1) Create a notepad file named hellopython.txt on the desktop 

 ```python

 ```  
After modifying the suffix, the Windows system will automatically call the PyCharm program to set the file icon. If it is not displayed correctly, students can open the folder option and check whether it is ticked to hide the extension of the known file type. If ticked, you need to remove it, and then modify the suffix of the file again.

After the script is created, open the hellopython.py with PyCharm and write the following Python code:

 ```  
Press the keyboard shortcut SHIFT + F10, you can execute the program in the window, the program output is hello python. 

##  2.3.3 code line by line 

The beginning of the file is enclosed in English three quotation marks "", which is a header comment, where @author is used to indicate the author of the program, and @desc is used to indicate the description of the program.

Print is a built-in function in Python that prints the value of an expression. The Python interpreter will output the string hello world to the monitor when the line print ("hello python") is executed.
