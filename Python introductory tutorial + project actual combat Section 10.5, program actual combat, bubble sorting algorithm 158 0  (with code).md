##  Introduction to 10.5.1 Sorting Algorithm 

The so-called sorting refers to arranging the elements in the data collection in order from small to large, or in order from large to small. The former is called ascending sorting, and the latter is called descending sorting. In this course on Data Structures and Algorithms, we will learn many sorting-related algorithms, such as Bubble Sort Algorithm, Select Sort Algorithm, Quick Sort Algorithm, Heap Sort Algorithm, etc. In this tutorial, we will master the very classic Bubble Sort algorithm. 

##  10.5.2 Bubble Sort Algorithm 

The principle of the bubble sort algorithm is very simple. The adjacent elements are compared in pairs, and the positions are swapped according to the relationship between ascending or descending order. For example, in ascending sort, the large bubble is placed at the back and the small one at the front. Compare n elements in pairs, and only need to compare n-1 times to find the most value. After finding the most value, the most value is automatically bubbled to the end of the interval, and then the next comparison is performed. The following figure shows the descending [3,2,1] list in ascending order using bubble sort:

According to the above principles, we now use the Python language to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm:
