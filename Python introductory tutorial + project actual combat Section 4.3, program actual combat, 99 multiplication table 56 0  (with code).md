##  4.3.1 print the multiplication table 

We learned the basics of the windows command line and common commands in the course of Section 4.1. In this section of the program, we will write a very simple Python program that outputs the 99 multiplication table on the command line. The output interface of the 99 multiplication table is shown in the following figure:

##  4.3.2 source code 

Create a Python script called multiplication_table.py on your desktop. After opening it with PyCharm, enter the following Python code: 

Python 

 ```python

 ```  
After writing the code, press the windows key on the keyboard, and then execute the cmd command to enter the windows command line. After entering the command line, execute cd Desktop to switch to the desktop, and finally execute python multiplication_table.py to output the 99 multiplication table on the command line.

Students should note that we have not yet officially learned Python. Students only need to run the above programs. 

>  If the program fails to run, either your environment is configured incorrectly, or there is an error in the code during the process of copying and pasting the code. Students should be careful and correct when learning Python at the beginning.
