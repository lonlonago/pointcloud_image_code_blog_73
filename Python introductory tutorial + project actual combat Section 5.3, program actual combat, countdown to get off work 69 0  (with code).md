##  5.3.1 implement countdown function 

We learned about functions and modules in Python in Section 5.2 of the course. In this section of the program, a countdown function is implemented with functions and modules: when the countdown is over, a prompt message is output to the screen. The output interface of the program is shown in the following figure:

##  5.3.2 source code 

Create a Python script called countdown.py on your desktop. After opening it with PyCharm, enter the following Python code: 

Python 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309574577661
 ```  
After writing the code, if you want to execute it in PyCharm, you can press shortcut SHIFT + F10. To execute it in the command line, you can press the windows key of the keyboard, and then execute the cmd command to enter the windows command line. After entering the command line, execute cd Desktop to switch to the desktop, and finally execute python countdown.py to output the nine-nine multiplication table in the command line. 

>  Students should note that we have not officially learned Python yet. Students only need to run the above programs. If the program fails to run, either your environment configuration is wrong, or there is an error in the code during the process of copying and pasting the code. Students should be careful and correct when learning Python at the beginning.
