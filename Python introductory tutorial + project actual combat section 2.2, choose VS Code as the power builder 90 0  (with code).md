##  2.2.1 VS Code 

VS Code, the full name of Visual Studio Code, is a platform-breaking IDE tool developed by Microsoft. Compared with the "clunky" PyCharm, VS Code is very lightweight and fast to start. 

>  PyCharm is "clunky" because it supports more productivity-enhancing features and is more beginner-friendly. 

Unlike PyCharm, VS Code is a completely free software and supports multiple development languages. In addition, VS Code also supports syntax highlighting, code completion, built-in GIT, and extensions through plugins. 

##  2.2.2 VS Code installation 

The download page of VS Code: Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined download page is shown as follows:

Directly click the blue Dowload for Windows button to download the windows side. If you need to download the installation package for other environments, click the drop-down box to select the corresponding installation version. After downloading the installation package locally, click the installation package to install. During the installation process, readers can configure the installation directory of the software and whether to create a desktop icon. After the installation is completed, start VS Code and you will see the following welcome interface:

>  The author does not recommend localizing IDE tools, it is pointless. To become an excellent programmer, you need to have a certain foundation in English. For students with poor English foundation, there is no need to deliberately learn English. You can start with the English you come into contact with during the learning process, such as the English words in the IDE, the English error prompts thrown by the Python interpreter, etc., in order to continuously accumulate English vocabulary. In this way, you can significantly improve your English level through subtle influence.

2.2.3 configure the Python interpreter 

VS Code customizes and extends the development environment in the form of plugins. When running and debugging Python in the IDE, you need to install the corresponding plugins first. 

Please follow these steps to configure VS Code: 

(1) Open VS Code and click the Tetris icon in the left column of the interface:
